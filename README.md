# Applications-of-the-mean-filter-in-image-processing
In this project, we implement the average filter with the help of convolution, Apply Robert Edge Detection to the Mosque image to show the edge intensity.
Apply the 3x3 mean filter to the original image first and apply the edge detector to the smoothed image.
We repeated this experience with the help of 5 x 5 and 7 x 7 filters.
We designed an mean 5 * 5 filter, the result of which is the same as applying a 3 * 3 mean filter twice.
We designed a mean filter of 7 * 7, which is equivalent to applying a mean filter of 3 * 3 three times and applied it to the image of the mosque.
